    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol type="i">
      The first thing you will need to do before you make this recipe is take
      all your ingredients out a few hours before you plan on making your
      cheesecake. The way to ensure the cheesecake will bake perfectly is for
      everything to be at room temperature!
    </ol>
    <ol type="i">
      For this classic cheesecake recipe, we are sticking with the standard
      graham cracker crust. Make sure your graham cracker crumbs are finely
      ground. You can use a food processor or blender to do this.Then mix your
      crumbs with granulated sugar and a little kosher salt.
    </ol>
    <ol type="i">
      Press this into the bottom and halfway up the sides of a 9- inch
      springform pan. I use the bottom of a glass to do this step. A springform
      pan is a necessity when making cheesecake. The sides are easily removed
      and your cheesecake will be perfectly intact.
    </ol>
    <ol type="i">
      Like I said, make sure that all of your ingredients are at room
      temperature. Not only will this ensure it bakes perfectly, it will also
      prevent your cheesecake batter from being lumpy. If you try and mix the
      filling up with cream cheese that isn't quite room temperature, you will
      get lots of lumps. A few lumps is perfectly fine, too many lumps will
      change the texture. After doing that just spread the cheese cake filling
      evenly over the crust.
    </ol>
    <ol type="i">
      Now, carefully place your cheesecake into the oven and allow it to bake
      for 60 -70 minutes. Don't open your oven constantly. I know it's tempting
      to see how the cheesecake is baking, but opening the oven can reduce the
      oven temperature and interfere with the baking process. Wait until the 60
      minute mark before you check your cheesecake.
    </ol>
    <ol type="i">
      Allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature for about an hour. THEN cover the pan with foil and it will need to chill in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, but preferably overnight.
    </ol>
    <ol type="i">
      When you're ready to enjoy your hard work, remove the cheesecake from the refrigerator. If any condensation has built up on top of your cheesecake, just take a paper towel and dab the moisture off. Then slice it and enjoy the fruits of your labor!
