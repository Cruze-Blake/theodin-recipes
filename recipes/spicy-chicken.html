    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      Hot Sticky Chicken Wings are a favorite for game day or even movie night
      This hot wings recipe is a crowd-pleaser dripping with zesty garlic hot
      sauce. Finger-licking and sticky delicious; bring on the napkins!
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p>
      CHICKEN WINGS I use fresh split wings with tips removed. If your wings are
      frozen, dab them dry before coating and cooking. COATING A dash of flour,
      salt, pepper, and baking powder are mixed together to create the coating
      on these wings. Don't skip out on the baking powder, that is the secret to
      a crispy chicken wing! SAUCE Use any kind of hot sauce (we love Lingham's
      Ginger Hot Sauce) in this recipe. Add in a bit of honey for sticky
      sweetness and soy sauce.
