    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol type="i">
      Mix all the above ingredients in a big bowl using a whisk or a mixer. Do
      this until the mixture turns to a smooth batter without any lumps. If
      there are any lumps whisk a way until they disappear.
    </ol>

      Now that the batter is smooth and lump free, you can let it rest in the
      fridge foe 30 minutes to an hour.
    </ol>
    <ol type="i">
      After the batter has rested you can warm up the pan and lightly drizzle
      some oil into it. Grab a kitchen utensil to scoop out the batter from the
      bowl. Once the pan has heated you can add the batter to the pan. Let it
      bake till the bottom is no longer sticky and then flip.
    </ol>
    <ol type="i">
      Repeat Number 3 until the batter is finished.
    </ol>

      Now you can plate your Flapjacks and add your toppings. PS. don't be shy
      add as many as you would like!
